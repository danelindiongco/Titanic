# Titanic
A Logistic Regression model trained using the Titanic dataset

I will be analysing the dataset Titanic from Kaggle found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv

The dataset has been split into 2: 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'. I will be training the model using the 'train.csv' dataset. The dataset 'test.csv' will contain the same columns as 'train.csv' except for the column 'Survived.' I will use the model trained by 'train.csv' to create predictions whether passengers survived for the dataset 'test.csv.'

I will first explore the dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn and then I will build a Logistic Regression Model first using Scikit-Learn and then purely from Numpy.

There will be 5 sections:

1. Exploratory Analysis - Exploring the dataset to identify trends and missing data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Training a Logistic Regression Model (Using Scikit-learn)
4. Training a Logistic Regression Model (Using Numpy)
5. Predicting Test Values
